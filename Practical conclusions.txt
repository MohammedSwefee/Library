Practical conclusions of mohammed Store :
---------------------------------------

- We usually use margin to move major containers like table , div ...etc to right or to left
- padding must be used on div to make your text content looks better
- hover can be easily implemented but DocType is very decisive
- Table border collapse can make table css look very nice , but without Doctype, results can be unpredictable
- using <p> not quite good because its hard to manage when aligning
- we usually use &nbsp; to crate white spaces between html elements like a , p , span ..etc , note that &nbsp; does not work with tables or div because its default positioning is absolute
- the styles that are used frequently on different pages are put in css file , meanwhile simple styling can be inlined in the same pages
- we have to specify major styles in the html or body selecters in css external file , such as default font family of the page ...etc
- padding can be very tricky in changing the width and height values of elements therefore we have to be very careful in using padding properties
- " class properties inheritence " is a very simple technique that is used to define styles for elements with in major container element , like Table th , Table td , Class a,Class p , ID div ...etc
- We need to study harder the referencing technique of images , pdf files , text files and any other type of files , and we need to know very well how to point to the location of any file inside the root folder of our website
- with full understanding of css properties and their possible values , we can create very advanced website styling easily and quickly
